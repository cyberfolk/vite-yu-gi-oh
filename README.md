# Vite-Yu-Gi-Oh

**Initial commit**: 17/04/23

**Tecnologie:** Vite, Vue.js, Javascript, Axios, HTML, CSS, SASS e Bootstrap.

**Info**: üÉè Here are the collector's cards of a game we grew up with Yu-Gi-Oh!
In this exercise, using Axios I queried an API to receive the cards from the collection and then subsequently print them on the site using the appropriate vue.js components. Finally, I added the possibility of filtering the cards by archetype using the v-model also offered by Vue.js... How nice to be able to admire the pieces of Exodia finally reunited!

## Milestone:

- Create a new project using Vite and Vue 3
- Define the components necessary to structure the layout.
- When the page loads, make an Axios call to the [Yu-Gi-Ho API](https://ygoprodeck.com/api-guide/)
- With the returned data, print a card for each card.
- Create a loader component to display until the results are ready.
